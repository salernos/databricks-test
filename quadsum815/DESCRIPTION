Title: Various R and Rcpp Implementations of a Quadratic Sum
Version: 1.0
Author: Stephen Salerno
Maintainer: Stephen Salerno <salernos@umich.edu>
Description: This package is in fulfillment of the requirements of Homework 00 for BIOSTAT 815. quadsum815 provides 
    five different implementations of functions to compute a single scalar value of the quadratic sum x'Ay. The functions 
    are as follows: (1) quadsumR: A loop-based R implementation, (2) quadsumS: A loop-free R implementation, (3) quadsumT: 
    A matrix-based R implementation, (4) quadsumC: A loop-based Rcpp implementation, and (5) quadsumB: A blockwise 
    loop-based Rcpp implementation.
